# Public Environment
To create a publically available environment, create a new branch on a fork of the repository. A PR can be used to include your public environment into the upstream here

# Private Environment
Some environments may be requested by owners to be kept private. If this is the case, you can create your own repository using the `Use This Template` button, then set your new respository to private. Please note: it is advised you only do this if you must. Pulling updates from a template's source can become tedious and may create problems for your workflow
